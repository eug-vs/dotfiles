# Environment
I try to keep my desktop very minimal and [suckless](https://suckless.org).

## General

### Dynamic Window Manager
I use my own patched version of [suckless `dwm`](https://dwm.suckless.org/): https://github.com/eug-vs/dwm

Patches included:
 - Respects [Xresources](../../.Xresources)
 - `Mod` is set to `Super`
 - Unused tags are hidden
 - Gaps between windows
 - Customized bar
 - [Swallow](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/swallow/) patch


### Simple terminal
I use my own patched version of [suckless `st`](https://st.suckless.org/): https://github.com/eug-vs/st

Patches included:
 - Respects [Xresources](../../.Xresources)
 - Zoom `Ctrl+(-/0)`
 - Fills all space allocated by WM


### Dmenu - application launcher
I also use customized `dmenu`: https://github.com/eug-vs/dmenu

Patches included:
 - Respects [Xresources](../../.Xresources)
 - Matches line height to statusbar


### Dwmblocks - status bar
I use `dwmblocks` combined with [i3blocks-modules](https://github.com/cytopia/i3blocks-modules) scripts for a cool status bar: https://github.com/eug-vs/dwmblocks


## Appearance
Appearance of all apps is controlled via [Xresources](../../.Xresources).

### Colorscheme
I <3 `gruvbox`: https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox

### Fonts
I use `nerd-fonts`, at the moment my font of choice is `Fira Code`.
