## Workspace generator
Script `~/.vifm/scripts/i3-workspace.sh` provides an easy-to-use layout generator:
```bash
./i3-workspace.sh ~/path/to/my/working/directory
```
It open opens `nvim` + 2 instances of `alacritty` in a new workspace. This script is aliasde to `:w` command in `vifm`.

## Bassboost mode
While key combination `win+b` is pressed, **crazy mic bassboost mode** is active. Basically it's just the toggle between two mic volumes - default and very high (up to the point when it starts distorting).
This is just for fun and probably should not be here, but I decided to leave it anyway.

**Note**: using this is dangerous since it might hurt someone's ears or damage the microphone.
