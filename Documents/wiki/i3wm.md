## Application launcher
I use `Rofi` (unconfigured) instead of `dmenu`: https://github.com/davatorium/rofi

## Screenshots
I use `ImageMagick` to make screenshots, see [`~/.local/bin/screenshot.sh`](../../.local/bin/screenshot.sh).

## Bassboost mode
While key combination `win+b` is pressed, **crazy mic bassboost mode** is active. Basically it's just the toggle between two mic volumes - default and very high (up to the point when it starts distorting).
This is just for fun and probably should not be here, but I decided to leave it anyway.

**Note**: using this is dangerous since it might hurt someone's ears or damage the microphone.
